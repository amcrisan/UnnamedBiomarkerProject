**Background:** LEfSe is a popular method for biomarker discovery; however, its statistical framing presents some challenges that limit its generalizability, such as the inability to handle different response types and qualitative metadata variables. We developed an alternative method that generalizes to multiple response types and can include metadata. We evaluated it on a previously published dataset of 16s rRNA from C. difficile-positive specimens collected from inpatients at a US hospital as well as C. difficile-negative specimens and samples from healthy community controls.

**Methods:** We analysed 338 samples: 94 with C. difficile; 89 with diarrhoea but no C. difficile; and 155 healthy controls. We compared biomarkers found by LEfSe in a previously published study against our new approach. We used three steps to select biomarkers: an abundance distribution filter, a Kruskal-Wallis test, and a penalized regression. We explored multinomial and continuous response types, in addition to including and excluding metadata. We crudely fit predictive models and used Harrell’s c (akin to AUC) to report raw and optimism-adjusted performance (to account for overfitting) for discriminating between cases and diarrheal controls. 

**Results:** We removed OTU 19 from the selection process because it served as a surrogate for C. difficle. Using a multinomial response, we achieved performance of 0.75 (raw = 0.88) and 0.76 (raw = 0.89) when adjusting for metadata and not, respectively, for separating cases and diarrheal controls. Comparatively, the biomarkers found by LEfSe had a performance of 0.71 (raw = 0.87) and a base model using only available metadata achieved 0.56 (raw = 0.64).  Next, we attempted to find individual biomarkers that could best predict the abundance of the C. difficle OTU (continuous response). We found a total of 12 biomarkers and achieved a performance of 0.73 (raw = 0.79) for discriminating between cases and diarrheal controls, compared to 0.58 for C. difficle OTU alone.

**Conclusions:** The limitations of the current LEfSe implementation may affect the type and utility of the biomarkers discovered and ultimately impact the adoption of these biomarkers in the clinic or elsewhere. A penalized regression approach provides a more generalizable and robust framework for microbial biomarker discovery.
