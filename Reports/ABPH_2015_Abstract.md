**Background:** LEfSe is a popular method for biomarker discovery, however its statistical framing has some issues that limits its generalizability. To begin, LEfSe relies on binary class comparisons and cannot be applied to continuous or truly multinomial response types. Furthermore, LEfSe does not include additional quantitative or qualitative sample metadata variables for biomarker discovery largely because of the limitations imposed by the linear discriminate analysis step. The result is that biomarkers are not properly adjusted against other informative, and perhaps more easily obtained, metadata variables. We propose an alternative method that does generalize to multiple response types and can include metadata. We explore its impact in a previously published study by Schubert *et al.* (2014)

**Methods:** We compared biomarkers found by LEfSe in a previously published study against our new approach. Discovery and validation efforts used a total of 338 samples: 94 with C. difficile; 89 with Diarrhoea but no C. difficle; and 155 healthy controls. Biomarkers were identified by three steps: 1) an abundance distribution filter; 2) a Kruskal-Wallis test; 3) a penalized logistic regression. We explored multinomial and continuous response types, as well as found biomarkers with and without adjusting against sample metadata variables. Biomarkers were discovered and performance assessed (via AUC) on the same samples, as was done in Schubert et al.

**Results:** Using a multinomial response, we found a total of 28 and 34 OTUs when adjusting and not-adjusting for metadata variables, respectively. Of these, 18 and 13 overlapped with the 42 OTUs previously reported by Schubert *et al.* using LEfSe; 24 OTUs were shared between when adjusting/not for metadata variables. Specifically, we were able to improve discrimination between cases and the respective controls - most notably, we improved the AUC discriminating cases and diarrheal controls from 0.873 (0.822 - 0.925) (using OTUs found in Schubert et al.) to 0.904 (0.862 - 0.945), when not adjusting for metadata variables, and 0.924 (0.887 - 0.961) when adjusting. Next, we attempted to find individual biomarkers that could best predict the diversity measures (continuous response), as Schubert *et al.* concluded that diversity may play some role in making patients susceptible to C. difficle colonization. We found a total of 51 biomarkers that predicted inverse Simpson’s alpha diversity, and achieved an AUC of 0.962 (0.91 - 0.973) for discriminating between cases and diarrheal controls.

**Conclusions:** The limitations of the current LEfSe implementation may affect the type and utility of the biomarkers discovered and ultimately impact the adoption to these biomarkers for broader application in the clinic or elsewhere. A penalized regression approach provides a more generalizable and robust framework for microbial biomarker discovery.
