# --- Normally LefSe does a Wilcox group wise filter here ----
# I really don't think that filter is necessary. You've already spent
# some alpha on the Kruskal Wallis test - why spend more. The next
# step can handle when variables >> observations, so I am going to
# give the next step as much reasonable data as possible.



#4. Penalized regression
#
# RATIONALE : Why not interpret the betas of a regression? Everyone
# knows how to do this, and does it all the time since regressions
# are such a common instrument. Using the glment package, we can
# use penalized regression to perform feature selection. GLMNET
# allows us to use lasso (alpha = 1), ridge (alpha = 0), and
# so called elastic-net (alpha between 0 and 1). By using either of
# the three methods of penalized regression we can control how many
# correlated features (lasso = least; ridge = most) are selected.
# Penalized regression has also been used in human microarray studies
# and are well suited from when variables >> observations.
#
# Also, in practice it seems that there isn't a huge difference between
# using LDA or vanilla binary regression (some sources include the elements of statistical learning - section 4.4.4: 
#  ... p. 105 - "it is generally felt that logistic regression is a safer, more robust bet than the LDA model,
#  ... relying on fewer assumptions. It is our experience that the models give very similar results,
#  ... even when LDA is used inapproperiately, such as with qualtiative predictors.)
# Thus, the substitution of regression for the LDA isn't supposed to be revolutionary. 
# But it does give more flexibility to work with (in my opinion)
#
# Penalized LDA does exist, but I still prefer the more direct interpretations
# of the beta's afforded by glmnet.

# could be parallelized to improve efficeny.
